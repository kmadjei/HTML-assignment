# HTML-assignment

First assignment for HTML Module @ Canadian Business College, focused on the creation of a 4 paged semantic website using only HTML.
 
## UX
 
The target audience for this project was for attracting clients interested in resorts with full spa services. 

The clients will consume the contents on the website feeling well informed and positive about making reservations at the resort.

## Features

The website has 4 webpages geared towards achieving the company's goal attracting clients.
 
### Existing Features
- **Home** page - Provides overview of attractive qualities of the resort.
- **About Us** page - Presents users with more information about the company and knowledge on what they do.
- **Our Services** page - Showcases the services that the resort has to offer for the clients interested.
- **Contact Us** page - Provides basic information about location and other ways to conact the Striped Umbrella Spa Resort.
 - Users can also send information via the online form for the resort to learn more about their clients in order to provide better services.
 
## Technologies Used

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
 - The assigment uses HTML to build basic structure of the website

## Testing

1. Webpage validation:
 1. Go to source page for all four web pages
 2.  Run each source code through [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and verify code passes the mark up for best practice
 3.  The errors mainly found was using outdated table attributes and the embedded text for the iframe element
